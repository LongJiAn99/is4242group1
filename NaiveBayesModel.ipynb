Since our establishment in 2013, Anytime Fitness has maintained our pricing for 10 years. However, after careful calculations and hearing feedback from franchisees, we have decided to provide clubs the opportunity to increase their price for existing members who have completed their minimum commitment period to help the clubs survive the rising cost and inflation. Factors that contributed to the price increase:\\n\\na) To compensate inflation throughout the years - Anytime Fitness clubs has been absorbing inflation cost for the past 10 years since 2013. As the profit margin gets lower and lower, we need to increase our membership prices so that we can continue to support our members and deliver the best fitness experience across all clubs.\\nb) The increase includes the upcoming 1% GST increment for GST registered clubs.\\n\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200bc) Increase in operational costs - Which includes, but not limited to; electricity cost, rental costs, and staff/manpower cost and others.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrequently Asked Questions\\n\\n(All AF clubs are owned and managed separately. The Price Increase Exercise is in-line with guidelines set by AF Singapore, AF’s corporate office. Clubs are implementing this at their own timeline and discretion)\\n \\n\\nQ :    As a loyal member for so long, why am I affected by the price increase?\\n\\nA :    We truly appreciate your support to the club. While it is our wish to always maintain loyal member’s membership fees, it has become unsustainable for the clubs in the long run. To ensure that the club can continue operating, this price increase exercise is inevitable. \\n\\n \\n\\nHowever, you can be assured that all existing members will still pay less than the current fees that new members are paying (standard membership of a 12-month plan is now @$118/month). You may refer to the pricing table for the details.\\n\\n \\n\\nQ :     Where will the additional membership fees be spent?\\n\\nA :     The additional fees collected will cover increased inflation costs, like rental, utilities, manpower and operating expenses. This is necessary so that we can help your favourite Anytime Fitness club(s) continue with their operations without having to sacrifice the quality of our members’ experiences.\\n \\n\\nQ:    Why am I being notified just before the price increase in the following month?\\n\\nA :     The Price Increase Exercise is planned in-line with corporate guidelines, and your AF membership agreement. Clubs have to give 14 days' notice before adjusting fees. You may refer to your agreement for this clause :  \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nQ :     Can I re-contract to a membership plan that is cheaper than my current one? - If you quality, you may do so before your next billing month (April 1, 2024 in this case)\\n\\nA :     Yes you can! If you qualify for the following memberships that are cheaper than your current one, please visit our club office and talk to our team for a re-contract : \\n\\nQ :     Can I re-contract my existing plan, and lock down the current rate for another 12 or 18 months? - Yes, please do so before your next billing month (April 1, 2024 in this case, however, terms apply, please read on)\\n\\nA :     You may also beat this current price adjustment by re-contracting your existing membership before your next billing month (April 1, 2024 in this case). Please contact the club office for assistance,\\n\\n :     Are all clubs in Singapore increasing their membership prices too?\\n\\nA :     The price increase exercise is ongoing. Clubs are implementing them at their own timeline and discretion.\\n\\n \\n\\nQ :     I would like to transfer to a club that has not increased their prices.\\n\\nA :     No staff or club can manually process a transfer, as transfers are automated by the system. You will need to utilise another club more frequently than your home club, for a period of 60 days, in order for the system to trigger a transfer. \\n\\n \\n\\nHowever, all AF clubs will progressively implement the Price Increase Exercise. This is also in view of the recent GST increase in January 2024 by the government. \\n\\n \\n\\nFor the AF brand to stay competitive, all membership prices will progressively increase in all clubs.\\n\\n \\n\\nPlease contact our staff on your new monthly fee if required, thank you\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor the purposes of data protection law Membr and Anytime Fitness Jurong Point will be joint controllers of your information, which will be processed inline with Membr’s Data Protection Policy and the relevant sections of Anytime Fitness Jurong Point Privacy Policy.\\nClick here if you would like to unsubscribe\", 'Category': 'Updates'}, {'Sender Address': 'store+14073856100@t.shopifyemail.com', 'Sender Name': 'Medicube SG', 'Subject': 'A shipment from order M186307 is on the way', 'Content': 'Your order is on the way\\nYour order is on the way.

Additionally, we recommend you to enable email enumeration protection on your existing projects as soon as possible.\\n\\nWhat do you need to know?\\nEmail enumeration is a type of brute-force attack in which a malicious actor attempts to guess or confirm users in a system by passing an email address to the API and checking the response. Starting September 15, 2023, we’ve enabled email enumeration protection on all new projects. Existing projects were unchanged, but it is recommended that you enable this protection on all existing projects to protect your apps against credential stuffing attacks.\\n\\nWhat do I need to do?\\nWe highly recommend enabling email enumeration protection on all your projects after testing with your app.\\n\\nIf you currently utilize fetchSignInMethodsForEmail (doc examples: Java, JS, Swift), your projects will be affected. When email enumeration is enabled, the fetchSignInForEmail API will fail. Linking anonymous authenticated users with an email address will also not work prior to SDK version 22.3.0 for Android, 10.18.0 for iOS, and 10.6.0 for Web.\\n\\nA full list of affected flows is also available for review.\\n\\nAdditionally, FirebaseUI libraries first run fetchSignInMethodsForEmail before allowing a user to sign in with their preferred method. If you have a dependency on the library, you should evaluate impact before enabling email enumeration detection. Once FirebaseUI libraries are updated (issue 1, issue 2, issue 3, issue 4), you should enable email enumeration protection.\\n\\nOne or more of your projects have Firebase Auth or Google Cloud Identity Platform enabled.\\n\\nWe’re here to help\\nIf you have any additional questions, please look through our documentation center.\\n\\nThanks,\\nMicah on behalf of the Firebase team', 'Category': 'Updates'}, {'Sender Address': 'gtan', 'Sender Name': 'gtan@comp.nus.edu.sg', 'Subject': 'Re: Introduction of Our Team Members for CS5233', 'Content': 'Dear Yangbin (Group 11)\\n\\nhere is your marksheet.

For context, 200k is roughly equivalent to around 150,000 words or a 500 page book.\\n\\nIn addition, all Claude 3 bots support adding images directly into conversations for richer interactions.\\n\\nLastly, we’re working on making Claude 3 available as a base bot for prompt and server bots.

In addition to answering a number of practical questions, our FAQ outlines some ways that you can share feedback to improve the experience for learners in your language. I have included them below for those of you without Google access.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce again, thank you for your commitment to expanding learner access to education over the last few years.\\n\\nThank you!\\nCoursera Localization\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFAQ\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1. What is happening with the GTC?\\n\\nOn December 1, we are shutting down the GTC Platform to begin a much-needed rebuild. Due to the age and technical limitations of the current GTC Platform, we are unable to offer our volunteer community the user experience you deserve. For now we are closing the existing platform and reassessing the future of the GTC.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2. Will I be able to continue translating during the shutdown?\\n\\nNo - we expect to make the GTC Platform inaccessible on December 1st. If it is still accessible for some reason after that date, we request that you do not continue to translate, since the work will not appear on our courses.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3. Will the GTC relaunch in the future?\\n\\nWe’re not sure yet. If it does, the earliest we may relaunch is late 2024. If you wish to be notified if the community relaunches, please complete this Google form. This form also allows you to opt in to participate in future feedback requests related to the GTC Platform if you so choose.\\n\\nIf you do not have access to the Google form, follow these instructions to opt in:\\n\\n\\nSend email to translate@coursera.org with subject line \"Opt In\".\\nDue to the volume of emails we receive, using the correct subject line ensures your information will be captured\\nIn the body of the email, provide the following information:\\nPreferred email address\\nTarget language\\nOpt in for receiving surveys in the future: Yes or No\\n\\n\\n4. What will happen to the translations I’ve already completed?\\n\\nPublished subtitles will function as they always have - they will remain visible on the translated video unless a change is made to the original course, or until the institution that owns the course requests we make a change.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5. What will happen to my translations that were not yet published?\\n\\nAll translations completed by volunteers are saved to our GTC translation memory, TM. This TM will allow us to publish most previously translated strings if we re-launch in a new system in the future.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n6. How can I help other learners who speak my language in the meantime?\\n\\nWe encourage all volunteers to provide feedback when they see translation issues on Coursera courses. There are 3 ways to provide feedback on the quality of Coursera’s translations. This feedback is monitored by Coursera’s Product team to help us make targeted updates to courses with sub-par translations.\\n\\nUsing the language toggle:\\n\\n\\nVisit the page you want to provide feedback about\\nUse the new language dropdown at the top of the page to select your language.\\nSelect the line that says “Add translation feedback” in your language.\\nUsing the \"Report an Issue\" button:\\n\\n\\nVisit the course and asset - video, reading, quiz, etc. - that you would like to provide feedback about\\nScroll down to the bottom of the page and click \"Report an issue\". This will allow you to provide feedback about the course. Be sure to mention which language the feedback applies to since this button is not limited to reporting translation issues.\\nIf you are taking a translated course, you can complete the survey that pops up after the first module. This option is limited to machine translated courses, which are indicated by “auto” appearing after the language name.\\n\\n\\nEnroll in a translated course.\\nComplete the first module -- this is usually the first week\\nThe system will auto-prompt you to complete a survey asking about the effectiveness of the translation.\\n\\n\\n7. Can I still list the GTC badges, certificates, etc. that I received on LinkedIn/my resume, etc.?\\n\\nYes - Any acknowledgement from Coursera of past engagement as a volunteer is still valid.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHelp  |  Privacy Notice\\n\\n© 2023 Coursera Inc.
