It can handle complex analysis, longer tasks with multiple steps, and higher-order math and coding tasks.\nClaude 3 Sonnet: This model strikes a balance between intelligence and speed.\nClaude 3 Haiku: Their fastest and most compact model, will be added on Poe as soon as it's made available.\nWe‚Äôve also added two additional bots - Claude 3 Opus-200k and Claude 3 Sonnet-200k - which feature expanded context windows that allow you to input vast amounts of information with near-perfect recall, making them great for complex tasks and multi-step instructions. For context, 200k is roughly equivalent to around 150,000 words or a 500 page book.\n\nIn addition, all Claude 3 bots support adding images directly into conversations for richer interactions.\n\nLastly, we‚Äôre working on making Claude 3 available as a base bot for prompt and server bots.

Two years later, the call from BMDP caught him by surprise!\n\nInitially raising suspicions of a scam, the familiar voice on the other end turned out to be his neighbour. This was a BMDP staff member who would be the one to guide and support him through his donation journey.\n \n\nAll smiles with Shen Hao and his neighbour as he donated via PBSC üòä\n\n\nFrom marrow donor to Ambassador\n \nIn January 2024, Shen Hao proudly embraced his role as a BMDP Ambassador, inviting us to his workplace for an educational talk where he shared with colleagues on his journey from signing up, to being found a match and finally undergoing the donation process.\n \n\n\nJoining us as well was fellow BMDP Ambassador Sapna, who was once diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and it was critical. Due to the urgency to have a transplant, the doctors looked to her daughter for a haplo-identical transplant. Thankfully, it was successful and now, with a renewed purpose in life, she is dedicating herself to the cause of BMDP, urging others to join our registry. We were all also touched to hear her daughter declaring that she stands ready to donate if found to be a match to another patient.\n \n\nSurvivor Sapna joining forces with Shen Hao\n\nListening to the journeys of both a marrow donor and a survivor, many of the staff were inspired by the duo and proceeded to sign up. \n \n\n\nAs you wait for that magical call that you are a match to a patient, you have the power to help patients by inviting us to do a sharing and donor recruitment drive at your workplace or community. Just like Shen Hao had! Email us at dr@bmdp.org or drop us a message in our LinkedIn to harness your power of hope!",

I was always the ‚Äòchubby kid‚Äô, so that created a really bad negative impact in my mind that I was ugly. I didn‚Äôt really see myself as attractive, growing into pre-adolescence.

Click here for Emily‚Äôs story (two-minute video)¬†and learn how Girl Up improves and strengthens girls‚Äô mental health and well-being.\nWhen examining youth substance use, experiences of violence, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors, female students are faring worse than males.[1] In 2021, 20% of girls in the U.S. reported experiencing sexual violence during the past year, 60% experienced persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness, and 25% made a suicide plan.\n¬†\nYet, despite these horrifying facts, Emily shares what we hear from Girl Up members every day: that mental health remains a stigmatized topic, and many youth suffer alone. ‚ÄúProfessional help is really hard to find for teenagers and young adults. Through Girl Up, I really discovered a community that was close-knit. We had a shared common purpose, and very similar lived experiences.‚Äù‚Ä®‚Ä®With your gift to Girl Up today, you‚Äôll support immediate, meaningful connections all over the world.

And we will all be there, in that future. So it's a really good investment to invest in girls, because we all want to live in a better world.‚Äù‚Ä®‚Ä®Donate now for a better world - for girls and for us all.‚Ä®‚Ä®Thank you,\nMelissa Kilby‚Ä®Chief Executive Officer, Girl Up",

        "Content": "Hi Long,\nWe‚Äôre writing to let you know that to increase the default protection against email enumeration attacks, all new projects created after September 15, 2023 will now have email enumeration protection enabled. Additionally, we recommend you to enable email enumeration protection on your existing projects as soon as possible.\n\nWhat do you need to know?\nEmail enumeration is a type of brute-force attack in which a malicious actor attempts to guess or confirm users in a system by passing an email address to the API and checking the response. Starting September 15, 2023, we‚Äôve enabled email enumeration protection on all new projects. Existing projects were unchanged, but it is recommended that you enable this protection on all existing projects to protect your apps against credential stuffing attacks.\n\nWhat do I need to do?\nWe highly recommend enabling email enumeration protection on all your projects after testing with your app.\n\nIf you currently utilize fetchSignInMethodsForEmail (doc examples: Java, JS, Swift), your projects will be affected. When email enumeration is enabled, the fetchSignInForEmail API will fail. Linking anonymous authenticated users with an email address will also not work prior to SDK version 22.3.0 for Android, 10.18.0 for iOS, and 10.6.0 for Web.\n\nA full list of affected flows is also available for review.\n\nAdditionally, FirebaseUI libraries first run fetchSignInMethodsForEmail before allowing a user to sign in with their preferred method. If you have a dependency on the library, you should evaluate impact before enabling email enumeration detection. Once FirebaseUI libraries are updated (issue 1, issue 2, issue 3, issue 4), you should enable email enumeration protection.\n\nOne or more of your projects have Firebase Auth or Google Cloud Identity Platform enabled.\n\nWe‚Äôre here to help\nIf you have any additional questions, please look through our documentation center.\n\nThanks,\nMicah on behalf of the Firebase team",

        "Content": "Price Increase from 1 Jan 2024 ‚Äì Existing Members\n \n\nReason for Price Increase for Existing Members\n\nAnytime Fitness pride ourselves as one of the more affordable 24/7 gym membership provider in Singapore and we hope to continue to provide the best value while offering competitive rates against our competitors. Since our establishment in 2013, Anytime Fitness has maintained our pricing for 10 years. However, after careful calculations and hearing feedback from franchisees, we have decided to provide clubs the opportunity to increase their price for existing members who have completed their minimum commitment period to help the clubs survive the rising cost and inflation. Factors that contributed to the price increase:\n\na) To compensate inflation throughout the years - Anytime Fitness clubs has been absorbing inflation cost for the past 10 years since 2013. As the profit margin gets lower and lower, we need to increase our membership prices so that we can continue to support our members and deliver the best fitness experience across all clubs.\nb) The increase includes the upcoming 1% GST increment for GST registered clubs.\n‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äãc) Increase in operational costs - Which includes, but not limited to; electricity cost, rental costs, and staff/manpower cost and others.\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n(All AF clubs are owned and managed separately. The Price Increase Exercise is in-line with guidelines set by AF Singapore, AF‚Äôs corporate office. Clubs are implementing this at their own timeline and discretion)\n \n\nQ :    As a loyal member for so long, why am I affected by the price increase?\n\nA :    We truly appreciate your support to the club. While it is our wish to always maintain loyal member‚Äôs membership fees, it has become unsustainable for the clubs in the long run. To ensure that the club can continue operating, this price increase exercise is inevitable. \n\n \n\nHowever, you can be assured that all existing members will still pay less than the current fees that new members are paying (standard membership of a 12-month plan is now @$118/month). You may refer to the pricing table for the details.\n\n \n\nQ :     Where will the additional membership fees be spent?\n\nA :     The additional fees collected will cover increased inflation costs, like rental, utilities, manpower and operating expenses. This is necessary so that we can help your favourite Anytime Fitness club(s) continue with their operations without having to sacrifice the quality of our members‚Äô experiences.\n \n\nQ:    Why am I being notified just before the price increase in the following month?\n\nA :     The Price Increase Exercise is planned in-line with corporate guidelines, and your AF membership agreement. Clubs have to give 14 days' notice before adjusting fees. You may refer to your agreement for this clause :  \n\n\n\n \n\nQ :     Can I re-contract to a membership plan that is cheaper than my current one? - If you quality, you may do so before your next billing month (April 1, 2024 in this case)\n\nA :     Yes you can! If you qualify for the following memberships that are cheaper than your current one, please visit our club office and talk to our team for a re-contract : \n\nQ :     Can I re-contract my existing plan, and lock down the current rate for another 12 or 18 months? - Yes, please do so before your next billing month (April 1, 2024 in this case, however, terms apply, please read on)\n\nA :     You may also beat this current price adjustment by re-contracting your existing membership before your next billing month (April 1, 2024 in this case). Please contact the club office for assistance,\n\n :     Are all clubs in Singapore increasing their membership prices too?\n\nA :     The price increase exercise is ongoing. Clubs are implementing them at their own timeline and discretion.\n\n \n\nQ :     I would like to transfer to a club that has not increased their prices.\n\nA :     No staff or club can manually process a transfer, as transfers are automated by the system. You will need to utilise another club more frequently than your home club, for a period of 60 days, in order for the system to trigger a transfer. \n\n \n\nHowever, all AF clubs will progressively implement the Price Increase Exercise. This is also in view of the recent GST increase in January 2024 by the government. \n\n \n\nFor the AF brand to stay competitive, all membership prices will progressively increase in all clubs.\n\n \n\nPlease contact our staff on your new monthly fee if required, thank you\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of data protection law Membr and Anytime Fitness Jurong Point will be joint controllers of your information, which will be processed inline with Membr‚Äôs Data Protection Policy and the relevant sections of Anytime Fitness Jurong Point Privacy Policy.\nClick here if you would like to unsubscribe",

        "Content": "GTC platform update\n\n\n\n\nHello to our Global Translator Community!\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your patience and dedication to expanding education access to global learners! I‚Äôm writing to let you know about big changes coming up for the GTC.\n\n\n\n\nWe know that GTC Platform is creating a very frustrating experience for you, so it has become clear to us that the platform needs to be completely overhauled.After extensive discussions with our Product team, we have all agreed to close down the GTC platform to avoid even further disruption and challenges for translators.\n\n\n\n\nWe expect to turn off access to the GTC platform on December 1, 2023.\n\n\n\n\nIf you would like to be notified if the platform relaunches in the future, please fill out this form. You will also be able to opt in to being contacted for surveys about the future of the GTC. If you do not have access to Google forms, please review the FAQ for instructions.\n\n\n\n\nWe understand that the translated experience is important to you. In addition to answering a number of practical questions, our FAQ outlines some ways that you can share feedback to improve the experience for learners in your language. I have included them below for those of you without Google access.\n\n\n\n\nOnce again, thank you for your commitment to expanding learner access to education over the last few years.\n\nThank you!\nCoursera Localization\n\n\n\n\nFAQ\n\n\n\n\n1. What is happening with the GTC?\n\nOn December 1, we are shutting down the GTC Platform to begin a much-needed rebuild. Due to the age and technical limitations of the current GTC Platform, we are unable to offer our volunteer community the user experience you deserve. For now we are closing the existing platform and reassessing the future of the GTC.\n\n\n\n\n2. Will I be able to continue translating during the shutdown?\n\nNo - we expect to make the GTC Platform inaccessible on December 1st. If it is still accessible for some reason after that date, we request that you do not continue to translate, since the work will not appear on our courses.\n\n\n\n\n3. Will the GTC relaunch in the future?\n\nWe‚Äôre not sure yet. If it does, the earliest we may relaunch is late 2024. If you wish to be notified if the community relaunches, please complete this Google form. This form also allows you to opt in to participate in future feedback requests related to the GTC Platform if you so choose.\n\nIf you do not have access to the Google form, follow these instructions to opt in:\n\n\nSend email to translate@coursera.org with subject line \"Opt In\".\nDue to the volume of emails we receive, using the correct subject line ensures your information will be captured\nIn the body of the email, provide the following information:\nPreferred email address\nTarget language\nOpt in for receiving surveys in the future: Yes or No\n\n\n4. What will happen to the translations I‚Äôve already completed?\n\nPublished subtitles will function as they always have - they will remain visible on the translated video unless a change is made to the original course, or until the institution that owns the course requests we make a change.\n\n\n\n\n5. What will happen to my translations that were not yet published?\n\nAll translations completed by volunteers are saved to our GTC translation memory, TM. This TM will allow us to publish most previously translated strings if we re-launch in a new system in the future.\n\n\n\n\n6. How can I help other learners who speak my language in the meantime?\n\nWe encourage all volunteers to provide feedback when they see translation issues on Coursera courses. There are 3 ways to provide feedback on the quality of Coursera‚Äôs translations. This feedback is monitored by Coursera‚Äôs Product team to help us make targeted updates to courses with sub-par translations.\n\nUsing the language toggle:\n\n\nVisit the page you want to provide feedback about\nUse the new language dropdown at the top of the page to select your language.\nSelect the line that says ‚ÄúAdd translation feedback‚Äù in your language.\nUsing the \"Report an Issue\" button:\n\n\nVisit the course and asset - video, reading, quiz, etc. - that you would like to provide feedback about\nScroll down to the bottom of the page and click \"Report an issue\". This will allow you to provide feedback about the course. Be sure to mention which language the feedback applies to since this button is not limited to reporting translation issues.\nIf you are taking a translated course, you can complete the survey that pops up after the first module. This option is limited to machine translated courses, which are indicated by ‚Äúauto‚Äù appearing after the language name.\n\n\nEnroll in a translated course.\nComplete the first module -- this is usually the first week\nThe system will auto-prompt you to complete a survey asking about the effectiveness of the translation.\n\n\n7. Can I still list the GTC badges, certificates, etc. that I received on LinkedIn/my resume, etc.?\n\nYes - Any acknowledgement from Coursera of past engagement as a volunteer is still valid.\n\n\n\n\nHelp  |  Privacy Notice\n\n¬© 2023 Coursera Inc.
